    "# Getting Started\n",
    "`IMP.bff` is an open source framework for Bayesian modeling of fluorescence data. BFF provides various tools for data processing and preprocessing. IMP.bff is not an application in the traditional sense: there is no program called `IMP.bff` that you run. `IMP.bff` is a collection of libraries and different programs written in C++ and the Python programming language. Those libraries and programs can easily be chained together to create tools and pipelines for integrative modeling with fluorescence information with the integrative modeling platform (IMP). Don’t worry, you don’t need to know anything about Python programming to use existing simulation pipelines. You can use the existing application examples as templates.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if you do not mind doing a little programming, this approach gives you enormous power and flexibility. Your script has complete access to the entire IMP and `IMP.bff` application programming interface (API), as well as the full power of the Python language and libraries. You have complete control over every detail of the integrative modeling process, from defining the representation of your system to analyzing the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this guide is to illustrate some of the main `IMP.bff` features. It assumes a very basic working knowledge on the integrative modeling platform (IMP), fluorescence spectroscopy (decay analysis, correlation spectroscopy, etc.). Please refer to our [installation instructions](install.rst) for installing `IMP.bff`."

    "## Accessible volume simulations\n",
    "As part of the integrative modeling platform [IMP](https://integrativemodeling.org/) `IMP.bff` can be used for molecular integrative modeling with experimental fluorescence information. To relate a structure to a fluorescence observable, the fluorescence properties of the respective structure needs to be simulated. For accurate integrative modeling, it the fluorophores need to be modeled along with the molecular structure <cite data-cite=\"kalinin2012toolkit\"><cite />. An efficient approach is to compute the sterical allowed conformational space (the fluorophore's accessible volume, AV). For these simulations `IMP.bff` implements efficient search algorithms that allow to \"decorate\" particles in a structure with AVs. The code below outlines a minimal example how to decorate a particle with an AV.\n",
