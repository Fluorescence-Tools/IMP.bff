Note that detection efficiencies are difficult to measure <cite data-cite=\"fries1998quantitative,sabanayagam2005using\"></cite>, but the ratio of detection efficiencies can be calibrated with a known sample (see section 2.5.1).  Equation (5) is not corrected for direct excitation of the acceptor, therefore care has to be taken to choose the appropriate donor excitation wavelength. The latter is taken into account in an alternative intensity-based approach developed by <cite data-cite=\"clegg199218\"></cite>. Here, the acceptor intensity ratio from signal after direct and FRET mediated excitation is calculated yielding transfer efficiencies being less prone to experimental artifacts. As in all ensemble FRET experiments, a knowledge of the degree of labeling is mandatory for a quantitative analysis."
