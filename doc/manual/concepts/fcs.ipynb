    "Confocal fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) is a powerful method to analyze molecular dynamics. FCS has single molecule sensitivity, is highly selective, and live-cell compatible. FCS has a broad measurable time range spanning from ~ns to ∼s. Moreover, FCS provides spatial selectivity so that e. g. in live cells membrane, cytoplasmic and nucleus molecular dynamics can be easily distinguished.\n",

    "The main underlying principle in correlation spectroscopy is the statistical analysis of intensity fluctuations emitted by fluorescently labeled biomolecules by correlation analysis. The resulting auto- (FCS) or cross-correlation functions (FCCS) then can be further analyzed by curve fitting to eventually derive the rate constants of interest. In other words: The statistical methods FCS and  FCCS do not provide single molecule traces like in single particle tracking, but a dynamic  pattern or “fingerprint” of a probed specimen with high temporal resolution.\n",
