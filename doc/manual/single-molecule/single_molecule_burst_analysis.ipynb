    "## Multiparameter fluorescence detection\n",
    "In a single-molecule confocal experiment, single molecules are detected during\n",
    "their free diffusion through a confocal volume. The resulting photon bursts\n",
    "are selected from the recorded photon trace after separation of the background.\n",
    "Usually this is accomplished by applying a threshold for the maximum inter-photon\n",
    "time and a minimum photon number within a burst (typically 30-160 photons). The\n",
    "burst-duration is determined mainly by the experimental setup and the molecular\n",
    "dimensions. As the molecules are freely diffusing a distribution of burst durations\n",
    "is observed and the fluorescence observables are averaged according to the individual\n",
    "burst durations. To obtain equal averaging the observation times can be unified \n",

    "Due to the low number of photons (60-500 photons per burst) detected per burst it\n",
    "is not reasonable to apply complex models to describe the fluorescence intensity\n",
    "decays. However, an averaged fluorescence lifetime can be determined for each burst\n",
    "using maximum likelihood algorithms :cite:`maus2001experimental`. Note that the determined lifetime\n",
    "is the fluorescence weighted average lifetime, :$\\langle \\tau \\rangle_F$, and not the\n",
    "species weighted average lifetime, $\\langle \\tau \\rangle_x$. Given a mixture of\n",
